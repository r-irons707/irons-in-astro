								Hello! I am a fourth year in the Astronomical Sciences Specialist at UofT. You can find me roaming around campus or in a hidden
								study space. I frequent any conference or talk held at UofT. Most recently has been the Scintillometry Workshop, but I have enjoyed
								the CITA 2022 Planet Day and RandoAstro this summer past. I enjoy filling my time learning new things (hence this new website) and
								expanding my skill set (my next project will most likely be CSS and JS to spice up this HTML file, unless I feel like keeping this astro
								prof. drip/style, iykyk). In the future I hope to get into some research and apply everything I have compiled throughout my undergrad.
								Currently I spend my time reading papers and doing personal research along with my school work.
